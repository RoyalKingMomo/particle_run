WIRING
=============================

The wiring and hardware setup for particle electron was pretty basic due to a lack of a GPS module (check [README](https://github.com/CalgaryHacks2018/particle_run/blob/master/README.md "README.md") for more details).

This was the base setup for our hardware, the attached antenna came with Particle electron IoT kit, similar to [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3234) one provided by **TELUS** at Calgary Hacks. For real and accurate GPS data, try Particle [AssetTracker](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/asset-tracker/) Shield.<br/>
